Hi, Goru here!

I see you are a newbie to use my software to install LunarCore, very interesting. Please join the discord server https://discord.gg/cfPKJ6N5hw for any issues shall arise but before that.

DO NOT INSTALL LUNARCORE ON A DIRECTORY THAT REQUIRES ADMIN PRIVILIGES (such as "C:/Program Files") TO RUN UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. If you are new, KEEP the directory installation to default, it is setup for the right way to run LunarCore.

If you have installed Java Development Kit (SE) 17, untick it (click the checkbox) before installing.

If you have installed Cultivation as well, untick it (click the checkbox) too but. If you have both installed, click the drop down then compact to uncheck all components below.

When you have Cultivation installed, search for the Cultivation software and follow the tutorial for it:
